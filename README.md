# Barcelona Bus Transit Analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes data from Barcelona's bus stop network to uncover key insights about the city's public transport system. The primary goal is to understand the distribution, operational times, and specific services like airport connectivity within the network.
## Tools:
-Programming Language: Python
-Data Analysis: Pandas
-Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
## Analysis and Insights 
-Distribution of Transport Services:
Analyzed the Transport column to determine the distribution of different bus services, including regular, night-time, and airport-specific bus stops.
-Airport Connectivity:
Identified that 7 bus stops are specifically dedicated to airport services, facilitating efficient transport to and from Barcelona Airport.
-Night-Time Services:
Discovered that 26% of the total bus stops operate at night, indicating strong connectivity options for travelers during late hours.
## Visualization
-Bar Charts: Visualized the distribution of bus stops by type of service, highlighting the percentage of night-time and airport-specific stops.
-Pie Charts: Presented a breakdown of bus stops based on their operational times to provide a clear understanding of service availability.
## Conclusion
The Barcelona Bus Transit Analysis provides valuable insights into the city's public transportation network, with a focus on operational efficiency and service distribution. This project demonstrates the application of data analysis and visualization techniques to real-world datasets, contributing to a deeper understanding of urban mobility.
